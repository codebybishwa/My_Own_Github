# 🌌 Planetary Orbit Simulation
This project is a simulation of the solar system with multiple planets orbiting the Sun. The simulation uses real astronomical data (planet masses, orbital velocities, and distances) scaled down to fit within the Pygame window.

## 🚀 Features
- Realistic planetary orbits based on gravitational forces.
- Includes planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
- Zoom feature: Allows you to zoom in and out to view planets.
- Gravitational Lines: Lines from the Sun to the planets for visual effect.

  <b>NOTE: <b/> The simulation is scaled, so you might need to zoom out to see all the planets (especially the outer planets like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune).

## 🛠️ To Run:
1. Install Pygame
2. Download the .py file and run it. A pygame window will pop up to display the simulation
